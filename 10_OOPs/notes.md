# Javascript and Classes

### Is Javascript an Object-Oriented Programming?

Javascript does have classes. This feature was introduced with the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). However, it is important to note that JS is primarily a prototype-based language, and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms.

### Object
- Collection of Properties and methods

### Parts of OOP
Object literal

- Constructor Function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)
